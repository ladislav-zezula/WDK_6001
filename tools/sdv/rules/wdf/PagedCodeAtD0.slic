	Summary: 
	Do not mark code as pageable within callabcks in the power up code path.

	Description: 

	When a function is marked pagable and the code section is paged out, 
	it will generate a page fault which could impact
    the fast resume behavior because the client driver will have to wait
    until the system drivers can service this page fault.
