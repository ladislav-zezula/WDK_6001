<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summary</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Toaster sample provides a starting point 
  for Windows® driver development. It contains annotated code to illustrate the 
  functionality of bus driver, function driver, assorted filter drivers, 
  class-installer, and device-specific co-installer for a hypothetical Toaster 
  bus and its devices. </font></p>

<P ALIGN="left"><FONT FACE="Verdana" SIZE=2>The samples in this 
directory are a rewrite of the WDM toaster driver (residing under src\general\toaster) 
using Windows Driver Framework. These samples show how to use driver framework 
APIs to achieve the equivalent WDM functionality with much less code. Only the 
drivers (bus, function, filter &amp; toastmon) of the WDM toaster package have been 
ported to use Driver Framework APIs. The 
installation instructions and test applications are same as for the WDM version 
of toaster. So read the instruction and test application files from

  The job of this driver is to service the TOASTER bus controller, enumerate 
  devices that are plugged in, and perform bus-level power management. The bus 
  driver supports D0 and D3 power states. It also has a WMI interface. This 
  directory contains two subdirectories that show two different implementation 
  of toaster bus driver (Busenum.sys).<p><i><b>static</b></i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Static version of the bus driver shows how to enumerate child devices 
    using static child list, one per device, provided by the framework. </p>
    <p><i>Static enumeration</i> enables a driver to detect and report the 
    existence of devices during initialization, with a limited ability to report 
    subsequent changes to the system's configuration. </p>
    <p>Bus drivers can use static enumeration if the number and type of devices 
    or functional subunits is predetermined and permanent, and does not depend 
    on the configuration of the system on which the driver is running.</p>
    <p>For example, a sound card's driver might act as a bus driver and create 
    separate physical device objects (PDOs) for each of the card's capabilities, 
    such as MIDI, audio, and joystick. </p>
    <p>To enumerate a child, the bus driver:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Call <b><u>WdfPdoInitAllocate</u></b> to obtain a <u>WDFDEVICE_INIT</u> 
      structure. 
      </li>
      <li>Initialize the WDFDEVICE_INIT structure. 
      </li>
      <li>Call <b><u>WdfDeviceCreate</u></b> to create a framework device object 
      that represents a PDO. 
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>After calling <b>WdfDeviceCreate</b>, the driver calls <b><u>
    WdfFdoAddStaticChild</u></b> to add the child device to the child list.</p>
    <p>Because drivers should only use static child lists for device 
    configurations that are predetermined and permanent, there is little need 
    for a driver to modify a static child list after creating it. If the driver 
    determines that a child device has become inaccessible, the driver can call
    <b><u>WdfPdoMarkMissing</u></b>. (If a child device remains accessible but 
    becomes unresponsive and unusable, the driver should set the <b>Failed</b> 
    member of the WDF_DEVICE_STATE structure to <b>WdfTrue</b> and then call <b>
    WdfDeviceSetDeviceState</b>.)</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><i><b>dynamic</b></i></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dynamic version shows how to enumerate child devices using child list 
    objects. </p>
    <p><i>Dynamic enumeration</i> enables a driver to detect and report changes 
    to the number and type of devices that are connected to the system while the 
    system is running.</p>
    <p>Bus drivers must use dynamic enumeration if the number or types of 
    devices that are connected to the parent device depend on a system's 
    configuration. Some of these devices might be always connected to the 
    system, and some might be plugged in and unplugged while the system is 
    running.</p>
    <p>For example, the number and type of devices that are plugged into a 
    system's PCI bus are system-dependent, but they are permanent unless a user 
    turns off power, opens the case, and adds or removes a device by using a 
    screwdriver. On the other hand, a user can add or remove USB devices by 
    plugging in or unplugging a cable while the system is running.</p>
    <p>Each time a bus driver identifies a child device, it must add the child 
    device's description to a child list. Driver can either use framework 
    provided device's default child list by calling <u><b>
    WdfFdoGetDefaultChildList</b></u>, or can create additional child lists, for 
    grouping children, by calling <b><u>WdfChildListCreate</u></b>. This sample 
    uses the default child list. A <i>child description</i> consists of a 
    required <i>identification description</i> and an optional <i>address 
    description</i>.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><i>Identification Description</i>: An identification description is a 
      structure that contains information that uniquely identifies each device 
      that the driver enumerates. The driver defines this structure, but its 
      first member must be a <u>WDF_CHILD_IDENTIFICATION_DESCRIPTION_HEADER</u> 
      structure.</dt>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt><i>Address Description</i>: An address description is a structure that 
      contains information that the driver requires so that it can access the 
      device on its bus, if the information can change while the device is 
      plugged in. The driver defines this structure, but its first member must 
      be a <u>WDF_CHILD_ADDRESS_DESCRIPTION_HEADER</u> structure. Address 
      descriptions are optional. This sample does not use address descriptions.</dt>
    </dl>
    <p>To add children to a child list, the driver calls <b><u>
    WdfChildListAddOrUpdateChildDescriptionAsPresent</u></b> for each child 
    device that it finds. This call informs the framework that a driver has 
    discovered a child device that is connected to a parent device. When your 
    driver calls <b>WdfChildListAddOrUpdateChildDescriptionAsPresent</b>, it 
    supplies an identification description and, optionally, an address 
    description.</p>
    <p>After the driver calls <b>
    WdfChildListAddOrUpdateChildDescriptionAsPresent</b> to report a new device, 
    the framework informs the PnP manager that the new device exists. The PnP 
    manager then builds a device stack and driver stack for the new device. As 
    part of this process, the framework calls the bus driver's <i><u>
    EvtChildListCreateDevice</u></i> callback function. This callback function 
    must call <b><u>WdfDeviceCreate</u></b> to create a PDO for the new device.</p>
    <p>To report a children missing, this driver calls 
    WdfChildListUpdateChildDescriptionAsMissing. For further details on dynmaic 
    enumeration, please refer to the framework documentation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <P ALIGN="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The sub-directories under this 
  one contain the source code of the function driver (Toaster.sys) for standard 
  toaster devices. To be illustrative and useful learning sample for beginners 
  to driver development, the sample has been built from almost nothing (simple) 
  to fully functional. You can either manually install the driver 
  (root-enumerations) or bus enumerate the driver using the toaster bus driver. 
  They all share one common header file present in the <i>shared</i> directory.</font></P>
  <P ALIGN="left"><i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Simple</font></b></i></P>
  <blockquote>
    <P ALIGN="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is a simple form of 
    function driver for toaster device. The driver doesn't handle any PnP and 
    Power events because the framework provides default behavior for those 
    events. This driver has enough support to allow an user application 
    (toast/notify.exe) to open the device&nbsp; interface registered by the 
    driver and send read, write or ioctl requests.</font></P>
  </blockquote>
  <P ALIGN="left"><i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">featured</font></b></i></P>
  <blockquote>
    <P ALIGN="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This version shows how to 
    register for PNP and Power events, handle create &amp; close file requests, 
    handle WMI set and query events, fire WMI notification events. This driver 
    is functionally equivalent to the feature2 version of toaster WDM driver 
    present in the DDK<br>
    (src\general\toaster\func\featured2). By being a power policy owner, it also 
    registers for idle notification so it can put the device to low power state 
    when there is no I/O activity.</font></P>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<P ALIGN="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>Filter</b></i></font></P>
<blockquote>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">
  <p>This directory contains source code of generic filter driver. This sample 
  also shows how to provide a sideband ioctl interface to an applications by 
  using control-deviceobjct. This private interfaces enables application to talk 
  to the filter driver directly, bypassing the functional device stack that 
  filter is attached to. Unlike the WDM counterpart, this sample only builds an 
  upper device filter (devupper.sys). You can install the filter sample on an 
  existing toaster device by using the filter.inf.</p>
  </font>
</blockquote>
<P ALIGN="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>Toastmon</b></i></font></P>
<blockquote>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">
  <p>The purpose of this sample is to show how to open a device and perform I/O 
  in kernel mode using remote I/O target interfaces. This sample registers 
  interface notification with the PNP manager for toaster interface class by 
  using IoRegisterPlugPlayNotification. When a toaster device is plugged in, PnP 
  manager notifies the driver by invoking the callback. In the callback, this 
  sample creates a remote target and opens the device by using the symbolic link 
  provided in the callback data. This sample uses a periodic timer to 
  demonstrate how to perform asynchronous read and write to the target device. 
  It also shows to respond to the device change notification by registering the 
  EvtIoTargetQueryRemove/EvtIoTargetRemoveCanceled/EvtIoTargetRemoveComplete on 
  the I/O target object. The technique demonstrated in this sample is useful if 
  you are writing a driver that talks to another device that your driver is not 
  controlling. Even though this sample is based on the WDM toastmon, it has been 
  enhanced to show some additional features of the framework. You install this 
  driver as a root-enumerate device using the Wdftoastmon.inf. The steps for 
  installing this sample is identical to installing the toaster bus driver. </p>

<h3>Building the sample</h3>
<p>To build the sample drivers, you must first set up the DDK environment on 
your host machine. The “Installation and Release Notes” in the DDK has a 
complete description on how to do this. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Run the build –ceZ command in the Toaster directory to build all the 
  drivers described above. 
  </li>
  <li>Copy the KMDF coinstaller (wdfcoinstallerMMmmm.dll), .sys files and INFs to a floppy disk or a temporary directory 
  on the target system. You should build the exe and other DLLs from the WDM 
  toaster sample.</li>
</ol>
</font>
<h3 ALIGN="left"><font face="Verdana">Installation</font></h3>
<P ALIGN="left">INFs files for each sample driver is provided in the same 
directory as the source. The steps on how to install the bus driver, function 
driver, filter and toastmon is given in the readme file of the WDM toaster 
sample. Please follow that.</P>
<h3 ALIGN="left"><font face="Verdana">Testing</font></h3>
<P ALIGN="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The instructions and tools for 
testing the WDF drivers are excactly same as the WDM toaster drivers. So use the 
exe provided with the WDM sample and follow the instruction given there.</font></P>
<P>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">In order to statically enumerate child devices everytime the bus driver starts, you can set a registry value in the Toaster Bus driver's device parameter key.</font><P>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\Root\SYSTEM\&lt;InstanceNumber&gt;\<InstanceNumber>Device 
Parameters </font>
<P>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
NumberOfToasters: REG_DWORD: 2 </font>
<P>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Maximum number of child devices that can be 
enumerated throught registry setting is 10. </font>

 
<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">You can also configure this value through the Toaster Bus Inf file.
